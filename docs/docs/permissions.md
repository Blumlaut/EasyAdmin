# Permissions


You can modify Permissions by using ACE in your server config file, each permission can be have an `allow` value or be denied by not including permission at all, you can add infinite groups, just make sure to add permissions for each group. 

**Note:** Do NOT deny permissions using `deny` this is broken and will not work.

Here is a set of example permissions that limit users in the "moderator" group to only kick, spectate, teleport, slap and freeze permissions:
```
add_ace group.moderator easyadmin.player.kick allow
add_ace group.moderator easyadmin.player.spectate allow
add_ace group.moderator easyadmin.player.teleport allow
add_ace group.moderator easyadmin.player.slap allow
add_ace group.moderator easyadmin.player.freeze allow
```

You can also allow all permissions by allowing the entire `easyadmin` category:

```
add_ace group.admin easyadmin allow
```

**Note:** This will also make you immune from being kicked/banned as it grants you the `easyadmin.immune` permission.

**This is heavily discouraged for anyone but the server owner, as it gives access to potentially destructive functions which only trusted people should have.**
