# Reason Shortcuts

As of 6.02, EasyAdmin can resolve abbreviated reasons into longer texts.

These shortcuts can be used to make writing reason a lot faster, "Random Deathmatch, please read our rules using /rules" can simply become "rdm", here is an example:


|                                   Command                                   | Shortcut |                     Displayed Reason                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `ea_addShortcut mod Modding&Cheating is not tolerated on this Server.`      | `mod`    | `Modding&Cheating is not tolerated on this Server`       |
| `ea_addShortcut rdm RDMing is not allowed, please read our Rules! (/rules)` | `rdm`    | `RDMing is not allowed, please read our Rules! (/rules)` |
| `ea_addShortcut stfu Please be respectful in Voice&Text Chat! (/rules)`     | `stfu`   | `Please be respectful in Voice&Text Chat! (/rules)`      |


The commands have to be added to the server's config file, after EasyAdmin has started.


These shortcuts work in every "reason" field in the EasyAdmin GUI.
